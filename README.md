# Official Amplitude React Native SDK
A React Native SDK for tracking events and revenue to [Amplitude](https://www.amplitude.com).

## **NOTE for iOS Targets**:
As of the v2.09 release we no longer require any modifications to the Podfile.  `use_modular_headers!` and `use_frameworks!` are no longer needed and can be removed upon updating to >= v.2.0.9.  If you run into any issues during installation it is likely caused by your pod cache and there are a few options to resolve this, see [here](https://github.com/amplitude/Amplitude-ReactNative/issues/46#issuecomment-802933175) for suggestions on how to resolve any caching issues.

## Installation and Quick Start
